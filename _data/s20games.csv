TRUE,code_warrior,Code Warrior,"Jason Allen, Shabir Ghulam",https://ud-cisc374.github.io/educational-game-project-team-12-jason-and-shabir/final/,https://ud-cisc374.github.io/educational-game-project-team-12-jason-and-shabir/final/egdd,"Code Warrior is a classic RPG game that you play by writing code. The game incorporates all of the classic themes that have made games in this genre so successful, while also providing a learning experience. The objective of the game is to reinforce basic programming concepts, and thus every action in the game is performed by writing code. The player will engage in scripted ‘battles’ where they must utilize pre-defined variables and methods in a logical way to defeat the enemy. Each enemy will have an attack pattern that is visible to the player, and the goal is to design a basic algorithm to counter it. Therefore each enemy attack can be seen as a ‘bug’ in the code, where the player algorithm is the ‘patch’.",

Make groups of sheep that represent a fraction to get points. Try to make as many groups as you can before time runs out! Many students get stuck when trying to depict fractions as a single object divided into parts, especially with fractions with odd-number denominators. These fractions can be easier to draw as a subgroup of a group of objects. Our goal is that after playing Woolgathering, students will be able to depict a fraction in this way.",

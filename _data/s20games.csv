The game incorporates all of the classic themes that have made games in this genre so successful, while also providing a learning experience. The objective of the game is to reinforce basic programming concepts, and thus every action in the game is performed by writing code. The player will engage in scripted ‘battles’ where they must utilize pre-defined variables and methods in a logical way to defeat the enemy. Each enemy will have an attack pattern that is visible to the player, and the goal is to design a basic algorithm to counter it. Therefore each enemy attack can be seen as a ‘bug’ in the code, where the player algorithm is the ‘patch’.",,https://github.com/UD-CISC374/educational-game-project-team-12-jason-and-shabir,Coding

If the player is the one with excess moles when attacking a card, the excess moles is converted to damage against the castle. The player's cards also has a volume stat, used for calculating molarity.
